      <h1>Decision Making Study</h1>
      <h2>Investigating the cognitive mechanisms that are associated with decision making under conditions of perceived surveillance</h2>
      <p>Many thanks for taking part in our research study. Now that you have completed the study we wanted to let you know about two aspects of the study that we did not fully explain in the information sheet you were given at the start of the study.</p>
      <p>We are interested in how perceived surveillance – feeling watched – may change behaviour.  In this study we had three conditions.  A third of participants made their financial decisions whilst a picture of human eyes was on the screen, others had to consent to switching on the webcam, while a control group had only a Magdalen College (Oxford) crest in the background.</p>
      <p>We are interested in whether there is a difference, in aggregate, between the scores of those in each group, rather than being interested only in the financial decisions you made.</p>
      <p>The study was designed to suggest you were paired live with a different anonymous other participant in every round.  In fact, this pairing takes place after the study is completed.  Each of your 10 decisions are individually paired with 10 different decisions made by other anonymous participants who have either already completed or will complete the task.  Once all 10 of your decisions have been randomly paired with 10 decisions from different other people, you are then paid.  Consequently, you are, as we informed you, paired with 10 anonymous other participants, it is just that this does not happen live, as we implied and led you to believe.</p>
      <p>You will now be paid £4.00 immediately via Prolific Academic.  As we need to pair your decisions with 10 other decisions, you will not be paid until sufficient participants have completed the study to enable pairing of 10 of your decisions with 10 random anonymous others. In due course, a bonus payment will be paid via Prolific Academic to the sum of your money that remained in each round.</p>
      <p>Participants in the camera condition will have noted that they were asked to approve switching on their web camera.  This was done to test whether your awareness that the camera was on would change your decisions.  You were not recorded and no data was stored by the camera, we just wanted to examine whether it would affect your decisions.</p>
      <p>Why was this necessary?  Research has shown that the presence of ‘watching eyes’, pictures or stylised images of eyes can alter people’s decisions, perhaps by making them feel watched, even when in reality they are anonymous and no-one is watching.  We could not have explained this in advance as your awareness of precisely what we were testing for might have influenced your decisions.  </p>
      <p>We could not pair you live with 10 other participants as this was logistically too complicated.  We would have had to have 10 people online concurrently, which would have made the process slow and complicated.  We couldn’t tell you you weren’t paired live as research suggests that one of the factors that influences people’s decisions in this task is concern regarding the ‘moral costs’ to themselves of inflicting negative consequences on others. That is to say that making decisions which effect other people negatively can make us feel bad, even when that person is anonymous to us and we are anonymous to them. We judged that a lack of immediacy might reduce the moral costs to you.  Thus we wanted you to think you were paired live with other participants, when in reality the pairing takes place after the study is complete.</p>
      <p>We would like to reassure you that this aspect of the research has been looked at and approved by MODREC and CUREC.</p>

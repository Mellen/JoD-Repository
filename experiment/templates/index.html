	  <h1>Decision Making Experiment</h1>
	  <h2>Instructions for participants</h2>

	  <p>Thank you for participating in this study. The study will last approximately 15-20 minutes in total, while this first task will take only approximately 5 minutes. It is therefore very important that you read these instructions for the first task with care.</p>
	  <p>These instructions are solely for your private use. You should complete this study on your own, away from others.</p>
	  <p>You will be endowed with £10.00 in total through the study (£1.00 per round over 10 rounds) and paid at the end of the study.  No other participant will know how much you leave with.  How much you are paid depends on your decisions and the decisions of the participants you are paired with in each round.</p>
	  <p>The minimum you will leave with is £4.00.  The maximum you can leave with is £10.00.</p>
	  <p>During each round of the study you will receive £1.00 of your £10.00 endowment.  There are ten rounds in total, hence your total endowment is £10.00.</p>
	  <p>In the study you are randomly paired with a different anonymous participant in each round. You are never paired with the same participant twice. You will not learn the identity of any of the participants you are paired with in each round, and vice versa - the other participants will never learn your identity.</p>
	  <p>In each round you and your new partner both receive an endowment of 100 pence (100p or GBP £1.00). You then have to decide whether to pay 10p to reduce the other participant's income by half (50p). </p>
	  <p>By paying 10 pence, you can reduce the other partner's income by 50 pence (£0.50). The other participant makes the same decision in regard to your income concurrently. She/He can choose between leaving your income unaltered, or paying 10p to reduce it by half to 50 pence (£0.50).</p>
	  <p>If both of you choose to leave the other person's income unaltered, both of you will earn the 100 pence (GBP £1.00). If both of you choose to pay to reduce the other person's income, both of you will earn 40 pence (£0.50) (100p-50p-10p).</p>
	  <p>If you choose to reduce the other participant's income, but he/she decides to leave your income unaltered, you will earn 90 pence (GBP £0.90) and the other participant will earn 50 pence (£0.50).</p>
	  <p>If you choose not to reduce the other participant's income, but he/she decides to reduce your income, you will earn 50 pence (£0.50) and the other participant will earn 90 pence (GBP £0.90).</p>
	  <p>You will see 4 practice or demonstration trials in which the dice roll is reported to help you understand clearly how the experiment works.</p>
	  <p>You will complete 4 practice trials in which the other participant’s decisions will be simulated and feedback will be immediate – thus you will see how your decisions affect the other participant and how their decisions affect you.  This is just a demonstration, no money is involved at this point and you will be told what the dice roll number was, the simulated decision of the other participant and how much you and they would have received if this practice round was a live trial.  After the practice trials, you will be notified that the live trails have begun.  You will receive no feedback in each of the 10 live rounds of the task.  This can make the decision-making repetitive.  We ask that you remember that your decisions will affect the income of another participant, just as theirs will affect yours and therefore we ask you to continue to consider each decision closely.</p>
	  {% if request.session.conditionDescription == 'Camera' %}
	  <p class="alert alert-info">
	    To continue the experiment you are asked to consent to switch your webcam on.  You may continue without doing so and without incurring any penalty, but it will aid the research if you are able to switch the camera on.  You must approve switching the camera on between every round of the task. Please be consistent in your responses - if you approve the camera’s use for the first round, please continue to do so for each of the next 10 rounds.
